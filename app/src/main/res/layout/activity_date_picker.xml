There should be a date picker object that allows the user to pick a given date (https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/pickers#java). Your application will then call the API: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DgPLcIlnmN0Cwrzcg3e9NraFaYLIDI68Ysc6Zh3d&amp;date=2020-02-01
You should modify the query by changing the date string at the end of the query. The API key in the URL is good for 1000 queries per hour. It is likely that once students start working on the projects, that we will go over the limit. You should probably sign up for your own key here: https://api.nasa.gov/.
This call will return a JSON object that has a URL, DATE, and HDURL. You should display the date and URL on the page, and a link to the HD image. If the user clicks the link, you should load the URL in the built-in browser on your device.
The user should be able to save various dates and images to the device for later viewing. The saved images should be shown in a list that lets the user view various images that are also saved on the device. The user should also be able to delete images that have been saved to the device.
